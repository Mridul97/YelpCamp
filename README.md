# YelpCamp
It is a Web Application with both front-end and back-end functionalities. HTML , CSS and JS is used for front-end and Node.js is used for back-end with MongoDB. It uses REST routing. This app shows the nice locations for camping. A user can also add new locations and also comment on locations. A user first has to sign in to use all these functions. 
CRUD functionality has been set up for both campgrounds and comments. A user can only edit a campground if that user has created that particular campground. A user can edit or delete a comment if that comment is made by that particular user.
